# Meta Review Prompt — Meridian Research Integration

**Context:**  
The meridian-research adapter tasks about learning integration (WS-TASK-006/008/042) pre-date recent architecture changes. Before acting, we need confirmation of the current integration state, missing capabilities, and whether these tasks require redefinition.

**Tasks in Scope**
- `WS-TASK-006` – Learning integration gaps.
- `WS-TASK-008` – “Short-term: verify integration.”
- `WS-TASK-042` – Verify learning bridge end-to-end, ensure ProposalManager flow, test learning cycles.

**Questions for Reviewers**
1. What is the actual current state of the research learning bridge and ProposalManager integration?
2. Are additional diagnostics/tests required before these tasks can start?
3. Should these tasks be re-scoped or merged to reflect today’s architecture?
4. Do they depend on core-level tasks (e.g., WS-TASK-053 or WS-TASK-026) that must land first?
5. What acceptance criteria should we enforce to declare the research learning integration “complete”?

Provide recommendations on whether to proceed, rewrite, or close each task.
