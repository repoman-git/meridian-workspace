## CRITICAL RULE

## CRITICAL RULE: Plan Before Execution

⚠️ **NO CODE SHALL BE WRITTEN OR MODIFIED UNTIL A CLEAR PLAN HAS BEEN FORMULATED AND AGREED UPON.**

## PRE-TASK GOVERNANCE CHECKLIST

**BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE, AI AGENTS MUST:**

1. ✅ **Read ADR-001-COMPONENT-PLACEMENT.md** - Understand component placement rules
2. ✅ **Read AI-GUIDELINES.md** - Review planning and execution guidelines
3. ✅ **Check WORKSPACE-TASKS.json** - See active tasks and avoid duplication
4. ✅ **Check CROSS-REPO-ISSUES.json** - Be aware of known issues
5. ✅ **Verify component placement** - Ensure code belongs in correct repo
6. ✅ **Check for similar work** - Avoid duplicate effort across repos
7. ✅ **Create a plan first** - NO CODE without approved plan
8. ✅ **Document decisions** - Update ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.json
